# Airtrack-rebuild

## Abstract
Within the open.make project we aim to provide openhardware by ourselfs. Therefore we construct the Airtrack with the goal develop rebuild instructions. The Airtrack was first published in the paper titled Air-Track: a real-world floating environment for active sensing in head-fixed mice in Journal of Neurophysiology 1st October 2016 Vol. 116. 
In this repository the reconstruction of the airtrack is documented.
