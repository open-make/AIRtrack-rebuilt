# Airtrack-rebuild

## Abstract
Within the open.make project we aim to provide open hardware by ourselfs. Therefore we construct the Airtrack with the goal develop rebuild instructions. The Airtrack was first published in the paper titled Air-Track: a real-world floating environment for active sensing in head-fixed mice in Journal of Neurophysiology 1 October 2016 Vol. 116. It was developed within in Larkum Lab by Mostafa Nashaat, Hatem Oraby, Robert Sachdev, York Winter and Matthew Larkum as well as Alexander Schill from the Charite Workshop.
In this repository the reconstruction of the airtrack is documented.
