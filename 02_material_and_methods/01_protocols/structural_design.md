### Type of holes
The holes in the upper Airtable contain balls depending on the size. The balls lower the needed Airflow. This is necessary if a to high pressure would be needed without balls. 

- Small Airtrack: no balls and platform with rim
- Big Airtrack: balls and platform without rim

The big Airtrack has a platform without Rim because the platforms needs to push the balls down to allow Airflow.
