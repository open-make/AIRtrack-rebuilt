# Requirements for construction

## Electronical devices

- Arduino-Uno microcontroller (www.arduino.cc)
- Pixy CMUcam5 by Carnegie Mellon University and Charmed Labs
- 50-mm linear actuator with position feedback (model L16 50N 35:1 12V; Firgelli Technologies)
- capacitive touch sensor module (MPR121; Freescale Semiconductors)
- active buzzer module (KY-012; KEYES DIY)
- 2 solenoids (2-way normally closed pinch valves; Bio-Chem Fluidics)
- H Bridge(L293D)
- 3v or 5v white rectangle-shaped LED
- 12-V direct current (DC) power supply (for linear actuator and solenoids)


## Base contruction
- 480x366 mm² or 200x200 mm²  
### 200 x 200 mm²
- for 20 x 24 x 3 cm they used 1mm holes each 8 mm
- working surface is 16 x 20 cm and circular platform 15 cm in diameter and 3 mm thick with a plus maze on top
- plus maze 5 cm long, 3 cm wide, and 3.5 cm and 180 gramms in weight
  - coloring of the moving platfrom for pixy cam  


## Further devices 
- linear actuator ca. 3 cm from nose of the mouse, the the licking spouts are placed
