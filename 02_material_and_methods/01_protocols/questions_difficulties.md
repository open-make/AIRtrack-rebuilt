# Upcoming questions and difficulties

## 001 Air ventilation
- pressure needed in relation to the hole size 
- type of compressor
- wanted friction of the moving platform 
  - distance between holes, different drawing in both designs (small and big table) 
  - bigger table seems to have way less air holes but bigger ones
  
### 001 Solutions in Paper
- for 20 x 24 x 3 cm they used 300kPa (ca. 45 psi) & 1mm holes each 8 mm
  - working surface is 16 x 20 cm 
- circular platform 15 cm in diameter and 3 mm thick with plus maze on top and 180 gramms in weight


## 002 Plexiglas thickness

- relevant for the box to resists the pressure
- relevant for the glue and screw areas at the borders


## 003 3D printing
- used material because of stiffness and weight
- accessability of the CAD files
