# Upcoming questions and difficulties

## 001 Air ventilation
- pressure needed in relation to the hole size 
- type of compressor
- wanted friction of the moving platform 
  - distance between holes, different drawing in both designs (small and big table) 
  - bigger table seems to have way less air holes but bigger ones
  
### 001 Solutions in Paper
- for 20 x 24 x 3 cm they used 300kPa (ca. 45 psi) & 1mm holes each 8 mm
  - working surface is 16 x 20 cm 
- circular platform 15 cm in diameter and 3 mm thick with plus maze on top and 180 gramms in weight


## 002 Plexiglas thickness

- relevant for the box to resists the pressure
- relevant for the glue and screw areas at the borders

### 002 plexi tickness
- 1 cm Mostafa recommended


## 003 3D printing
- used material because of stiffness and weight
- accessability of the CAD files


## 004 Arduino microprocessor
- build inside the arduino uno? required for pixy cam 

## 005 linear acuator
- only 100 mm and 140 mm available on rs.de
- on firgelli themselves also not exact the same as in paper


## 006 Struggeling to find the exact components
  - Freescale Semiconductors MPR121 not longer manufactured
  - KY-012 by Keyes DIY seems rare, maybe soon discontinued
  
### 006 
  - mpr121 not disconntiued but not very reliable


## 007 connection from sticks to apperatur
- how to connect the apperatur to the moveable arms
- depending on the apperature


## 008 decisions regarding components 
- which to choose
- linear accuator
- where plexiglas from 
- which power supply
