## 3D prints protocol:

# Maze X small (SMaze.stl):

1st print of:
- Basis settings without a raft and support
- 0,15 height, 15 infill, Temp: 60/200 

Result was very bad, interrupted in middle of printing
- often the outside lines move to the center

2nd print:
- Basis settings with a raft and without support
- 0,15 height, 15 infill, Temp: 60/200 

Result:
- Bad ground layer in center
- low resistance to forces overall


3rd print: 
same as second but 40 mm print speed, infill 25

- result: no big difference, a bit more stable

4th: (01-1)
9 pillars (d = 1 cm, h = 0,4cm) in below the platform, standard settings, infill 60


result way better, less loose lines in the center, way more resistant to forces at the upper surface and at the wall holders

5th: (02-1)

many pillars (d = 0,5 cm, h = 0,4 cm), same as 4th

result: even less loose lines at the bottom, similar resistance to force, some wall holders hold better and some less (unknown)

6th: (02-2)
as 5th but layer height to 0,3mm

a little more profile in surface but no big difference

7th: (02-3)

as 4th but layer height to 0,1 mm and temp of nozzle to 90, infill 60

result: worse center ground layer then in 5th and 6th, I think because of smaller layer height



## Large platform with edge cirle:

height with platform strenght and edge circle: 0,9cm
width of cirle: 1,6 cm
diameter: 30,1 cm
edge circle seems like 3D quarter circles and a ground layer of plexiglass on top of it
wall mounts are 3d printed and glued
